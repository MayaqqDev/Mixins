# MixinExtras

MixinExtras is a library by LlamaLad7 that adds several new injection types and "sugars" that make creating mixins much easier. This library is included by default in Fabric and NeoForge, and can be included in Forge via shadowing the library.

MixinExtras injections focus on mod compatability, and many regular mixin injections can usually be replaced by a MixinExtras injector.

Unfortunately, it is currently tricky to get MixinExtras working in legacy versions of Forge, such as on 1.8.9. This section will be updated in the future when better tooling is available.
